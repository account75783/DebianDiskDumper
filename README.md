# DebianDiskDumper

**DebianDiskDumper** is a tiny Bash utility that makes *ddrescue-powered*, bit-perfect backups of CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs. It even auto-detects the disc label, sanitises it into a safe filename, **and ejects the disc 30 seconds after the dump (unless you cancel).**

## âœ¨ Key features

| Feature | What it gives you |
|---------|------------------|
| **Auto-label â†’ filename** | Reads the ISO-9660/UDF volume label and saves as `My_Disc.iso`. |
| **`ddrescue` imaging** | Sector-accurate, error-tolerant dumpsâ€”perfect for scratched media. |
| **One-keypress workflow** | Press **Enter** to accept the suggested name, or type your own. |
| **Auto-eject timer** | 30 s countdown after completion; press **N** to keep the disc loaded. |
| **Works everywhere** | Any Debian-based distro (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, Pop!\_OS, Kali, etc.). |
